## Bonus:  

Use your own data with Azure OpenAI 

Once you have added the data to the Azure OpenAI studio, you will have your Azure AI Search configuration, you will need to update webapps' configuration values: 

You will need to add  

- OpenAI__SearchEndpoint 

- OpenAI__SearchIndexName 

- OpenAI__SearchKey 

 

Once the Search parameters are configured, the app will display the 'Use Custom Data Source' option on the Sandbox Lite page.

Remember to delete the resources after class to avoid charges. 

 

Big thanks to Rob Foulkrod for creating this alternate demo environment! 

## Additional (good to know notes): 
When you go to run it locally on your machine, you will need to do the equivalent of the app settings, this in found in the appsettings.Development.json file.
